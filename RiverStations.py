'''Python 3 script, which makes use of the modules: pandas, numpy, datetime, pgeocode, matplotlib.
These modules can be downloaded using pip. Script was tested on python 3.10.10

RiverStations.py has user inputs as it runs to select a measurement station. It then plots graphs for water level, flow rate, wind velocity and temperature if it has the readings.'''
